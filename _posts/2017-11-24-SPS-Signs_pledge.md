Lots of other clubs/orginzations here at UVA have pledged to make it easier for students who may be in a low-income situation to get involved. SPS has now joined this list, and we want everyone to know that we are commited to helping those who need it.

 

We have signed the pledge! We understand that when we, as organizations, fail to properly accommodate low-income students, we can perpetuate the barriers that an education seeks to erase. Thus we have pledged to make our organization more accessible to low-income students! Check out the pledge below!
