We had a great day of board games, donuts, and coffee! We played "The Resistance" and "Secret Hitler", two games which will have you doubting your friends' true allegiances. If you missed today, be sure to come next time we do this for a fun end to the week. Next time we do this, we'll reserve the room for another hour to let it go on for longer.

In the meantime, enjoy some photos!
