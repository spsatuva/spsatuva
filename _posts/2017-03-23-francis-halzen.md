SPS's advisor Craig Group invited [Francis Halzen](https://icecube.wisc.edu/~halzen/), a theoretical physicist involved with the [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/), to UVA for a public lecture at UVA's Rotunda along with a private lunch with members of SPS.

IceCube is an incredible neutrino detector in the South Pole. It is a 1 km$^3$ block of pure ice in Antarctica that contains light detectors inside of it at regular intervals. The detector captures light from extremely high energy neutrino interactions in the ice.

Professor Halzen spoke at his public lecture about the detector, its inception, its development, and its exciting discoveries.
