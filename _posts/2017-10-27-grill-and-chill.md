On October 27th, SPS hosted a “Spooky” Grill and Chill in front of the physics building.  We invited all physics majors and faculty to come enjoy good food and the great weather. We cooked burgers and hot dogs on the grill with plenty of other snacks. Because the weather was so great, we had badminton, giant Jenga, and Frisbees.

Thanks to everyone who came out, and a huge thanks to Spook Chef Jesse, Pedrom and Andrew Coffee for getting the food and grilling!
