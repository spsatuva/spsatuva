Last Friday SPS hosted a mentor and mentee event where we invited everyone to meet up with their mentor or mentee and have the chance to introduce themselves and enjoy some pizza.  There was a huge turnout and the pizza certainly did not last long. The mentees were able to ask their mentors questions about the physics program and their experiences as a student at UVA. We hope to do another event like this soon.
