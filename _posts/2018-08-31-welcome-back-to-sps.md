Hey all! If you're a first year or transfer, welcome to UVA! We have a fun semester ahead, so stick around. If you're not either, you probably know how this works. 

If you weren't able to make it to our fall inaugural meeting, here's a quick summary:

- Come to our meetings at 1:00 PM on Fridays! Cool talks and free pizza are plentiful.
- We have a lot of fun events *semi* planned!
- We're going to start up our peer advising again.
- Do research! We'll help you.
- Worried about GREs? Come study with us on Saturdays at 8:30 AM (ðŸ˜¢) in the TA room.
- Do research!

If this doesn't satiate your desires, [here](/assets/pdf/slides/WelcomeToSPS.pdf) are the full slides presented.

See you around!
