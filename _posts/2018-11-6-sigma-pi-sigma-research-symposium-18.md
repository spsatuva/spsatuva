In lieu of our standard SPS meeting this week, Sigma Pi Sigma will be holding their 8th annual research symposium in the Lower West Oval Room of the Rotunda. Join your friends and colleagues for a collection of fun presentations about what they've been working on recently. If you're new to research, this is a great opportunity to see what kind of undergraduate research projects it's possible to get involved with. On top of all of theat, there will be free food and coffee!
