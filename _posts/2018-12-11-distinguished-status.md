This year (2017-2018), the UVA Society of Physics Students was recognized as “distinguished”. Only the top 20% of chapters receive this status. All chapter award winners will be listed on SPS's [Outstanding Chapter Award](https://www.spsnational.org/awards/outstanding-chapter) page in the coming weeks.

Recognition for this award is dependent on several criteria, including contributions to student recruitment, participation in social events, interactions with the department's alumni, and outreach efforts. We aim to continue to excel in these areas in the coming semester.

In addition to being recognized as "outstanding" last year (top 10%), the chapter has also been recognized as "distinguished" for the 2014-2015, 2013-2014, and 2012-2013 academic years.
