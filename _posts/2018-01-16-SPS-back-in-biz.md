We hope that everyone had a good break and SPS welcomes you back to another exciting semester here at UVA. Today was the first meeting of 2018! We hosted the colloquium speaker Sho Yaida from Duke University who talked to us about his research in soft matter physics. We also had an open discussion about plans for SPS this semester and wanted to hear from the student body about what they would like to see from SPS.

Thanks to everyone who came out and have a good semester!
