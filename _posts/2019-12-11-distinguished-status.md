This year (2018-2019), UVa's SPS chapter has been named a 2018-19 SPS Outstanding Chapter for the 3rd time in the last 4 years. This is the highest honor recognized at the chapter level and is only given to the top 15% of all SPS chapters in the country. The Director of the Society of Physics Students & Sigma Pi Sigma writes: " You and your students have earned this moment of recognition. Your combined efforts supported the department, helped further student development, and strengthened the community."

Recognition for this award is dependent on several criteria, including contributions to student recruitment, participation in social events, interactions with the department's alumni, and outreach efforts. We aim to continue to excel in these areas in the coming semester.

In addition to being recognized as "outstanding" last year (top 20%), the chapter has also been recognized as "distinguished" for the 2014-2015, 2013-2014, and 2012-2013 academic years.
