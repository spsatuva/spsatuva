The Eighth Annual Undergraduate Physics Research Symposium was held on November 9, 2018 in the Rotunda in the West Oval Room from 1-4. Four undergraduates gave oral presentations of their physics and astronomy-related research at the event, and 4 undergraduates presented posters. Topics presented are as follows: 

# Posters
- **Margaret Doyle**: An Investigation into 400 nm Driven High-Order Harmonics
- **Cole Miles**: Reactive Moleuclar Dynamics Simulations of Structural Transitions in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
- **Nicholas Anderson**: Pulsar-Timing for Undergraduates: Research Meets Outreach
- **Andrew Jiao**: Magnetohydrodynamic Approximations of the m=0 Rayleigh-Taylor Instability in a Z-Pinch
