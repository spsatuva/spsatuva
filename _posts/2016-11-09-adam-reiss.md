Our SPS advisor, Craig Group, invited nobel laureate [Adam Riess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Riess) to give a public lecture at downtown Charlottesville's historic Jefferson Theater. SPS members met up for pizza downtown before attending the lecture, where we were able to meet with Adam Riess. Later, we attended his public lecture where he talked about his nobel prize winning discovery.

Adam Riess jointly won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Brian P. Schmidt for providing evidence of the expansion of the universe. His talk was accessible, informative, and enlightening for both the members of the public in attendence and the SPS members who met with him.
