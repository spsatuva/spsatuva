This week, UVA’s own Martine gave a short presentation about studying abroad as a physics major. Since the physics major requires so many coursers, and the fact the courses need to be taken in sequence, studying abroad can be a little bit tricky. Luckily Martine had the opportunity to study abroad in Scotland as an undergrad and has put together some resources that she shared with SPS so that other students are not overwhelmed.
