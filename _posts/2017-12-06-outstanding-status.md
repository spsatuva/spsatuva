This year (2016-2017), the UVA Society of Physics Students was recognized as “outstanding”. Only the top 10% of chapters receive this status (see award [here](http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/spsatuva/docs/Outstanding_2015_2016.jpg)). In past years, the chapter was recently (2014/2015 AY, 2013/2014 AY, and 2012/2013 AY) recognized as “distinguished,” signifying that our chapter is in the top 20% of the chapters in the country.
