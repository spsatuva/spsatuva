Last week we hosted the director of the medical physics graduate program at VCU where he talked about their graduate program. He advertised why medical physics is an interesting discipline to study and some of the benefits including the job market and career paths.

He also expressed the fact that they have accepted several UVA alumni in the past and they all have done well and found jobs.

We have attached a link to the power point and link to the department website for those that are interested.
