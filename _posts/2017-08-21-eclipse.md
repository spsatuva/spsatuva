In conjunction with the Astronomy Club at UVA, SPS held an event on the historic University of Virginia Lawn to provide all members of the UVA community and the broader Charlottesville community with viewing access to The Great American Eclipse. Hundreds of students and members of the community assembled on the Lawn on August 21st to view the eclipse with the help of the free solar eclipse glasses and the H1 and projections telescopes which we and the Astronomy Club provided. You can view a write up of the day's events in the Virginia Newspaper [here](https://news.virginia.edu/content/not-quite-total-eclipse-heart-charlottesville).
