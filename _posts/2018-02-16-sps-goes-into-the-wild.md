Whats better than going on a hike with your friends when its freezing?

Going on a hike with your friends when its freezing, but with SPS, coffee, and donuts!

We got together in the freezing cold and decided to go for a walk/hike through Ragged Mountain Nature Area with duck donuts and coffee. We had a really good time despite being so cold.

Thanks to everyone who came out!
