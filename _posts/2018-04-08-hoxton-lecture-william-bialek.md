Every semester UVA invites a guest speaker to give a lecture on grounds as part of the Annual Llewellyn G. Hoxton Lecture series. This year, UVA hosted William Bialek from Princeton for the 46th annual edition of the series. SPS was pleased to host prof. Bialek who addressed the students and talked to about his work and the future of biophysics.
