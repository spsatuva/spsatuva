There are three grad-school related pages on this site: `grad-school.md`, `grad-apply.md`, and `gre.md`. `grad-school.md` is an overview of what graduate school is and why one might be interested in applying. `grad-apply.md` offers advice on how to apply. And `gre.md` contains advice on the General and Physics GRE exams that one takes before applying to graduate school. 

# `grad-school.md`

This is a standard Markdown file, and mostly contains text which can be edited to your liking. The "Quick Links" that appear at the top of the page on the main site are controlled by the `quick-links` variable in this page's YAML front matter.

# `grad-apply.md`

Again, this is a standard Markdown file with few tricks. There are "Quick Links" controlled by the `quick-links` variable in the YAML front matter. The webmaster should take care to ensure these links are up-to-date and actually work.

# `gre.md`

Again, a normal Markdown file with "Quick Links". Note that the "GRE Study Resources" link should point to the collection of GRE resources our SPS chapter has compiled. This will likely live on the SPS shared Google Drive. Ensure that this Google Drive link is open to the public and accessible by anyone who has the link.
