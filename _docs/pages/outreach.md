# About Page

A standard Markdown file describing our outreach efforts. The webmaster should ensure this information is up-to-date.

# Guides Page

The list of guides contained on this page are controlled by the file `_data/outreach-guides.yml`. To add a new guide, add a new entry to the `guides` list with a `title` and `url` pointing to a published Google Document. In any Google doc click "File" then "Publish to the Web" in the drop-down menu. Click "Link" in the pop-up that appears. Copy the link that appears and paste it in the `url` field of your new entry. Guides can be stored anywhere, as long as they are a linkable Google doc, but they should be stored in the SPS Google Drive.
