This page is largely controlled from the data file `_data/phys1910.yml` with some Markdown text included to summarize the PHYS 1910 course.

# Data structure

There are four components of the file `_data/phys1910.yml`.

1. A field `current-year` which maps to a string, which should contain the current year of the course e.g. "Fall 2019".
2. A field `years` which maps to a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list should contain all of the information about who was involved in a certain year i.e. the `year` of the course and the `people` involved. `year` maps to a string for the year of the course and `people` to a list of people who helped run the course. Each person in the `people` list should have a `name`, a string with the person's name, an `image` a string which is the name of an image file expected to be located at `/assets/img/pages/phys1910/<image>`, a `title` which will be shown under their name on the page, and an `email` which will be shown under the title. 
3. `syllabus` which is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list should contain information about the syllabus to include on the page, namely the `year` of the syllabus and a link to the `pdf` for that syllabus.
4. `lectures` which is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the lectures for a certain `year` and a list of `recordings` for that year. Each recording requires at least a `speaker`, a `title`.

# About Page

The `current-year` variable should be set to the semester and year of the latest update. For example, if you only have information for this page updated until Fall 2018, you should have `current-year: "Fall 2018"`. However, if you update this page to include information for Fall 2020, you should set `current-year: "Fall 2020"`.

## Add new syllabus

Add a new entry to the `syllabus` list that looks like:
```yaml
syllabus:
- year: "Fall 2121"
  pdf: "<link-to-the-pdf>"
```
The link to the pdf can either be a link to a resource stored on Google drive (`https://drive.google.com/...`) or a link to a local resource stored on this site, e.g. `/assets/pdf/phys1910/syllabusFall2121.pdf`.

## Add new course organizers

Add a new year to the `years` list, like so:
```yaml
years:
- year: "Fall 2121"
  people:
  - name: Name of Person 1
    image: File_Person_1.jpg # will look for an image at /assets/img/pages/phys1910/File_Person_1.jpg
    title: Organizer
    email: person.ome@virginia.edu
  - name: Name of Person 2
    # continue the pattern from above
```

# Lectures Page

## Add a new lecture

Add a new entry to the `lectures` entry in the `phys1910.yml` file. If this is the first lecture for a given year, you will need to craete a new item in the `lectures` list with a `year` and `recordings` field with your first lecture as the only entry in the `recordings` list. If this isn't the first lecture in a given year, you will need to add the new lecture within the existing `recordings` list for the corresponding year of the lecture.

```yaml
lectures:
- year: "Fall 2121"
  recordings:
  - speaker: Name of the Speaker
    title: Title of Interesting Talk
    id: ec693cf7-a438-424c-87b7-163ba54b7a6f # if you don't have a recording ID, either leave this out or set id to "NA"
    slides: /assets/pdf/phys1910/speakers_slides.pdf # either a Google Drive link, other URL, or link to local asset
```

The `id` is the Panopto id for each video, which is taken from the Sharing URL generated by Panopto. e.g. with the URL: [https://uva.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=56b00aca-62f6-49e7-9f25-a457ab330228](https://uva.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=56b00aca-62f6-49e7-9f25-a457ab330228) the id is the last part of this URL: `56b00aca-62f6-49e7-9f25-a457ab330228`. If you don't have an id but do have slides to share, you can leave it out or set `id: "NA"`.
