The physics department at UVA offers three different degrees. The Bachelors of Arts in physics (B.A), The Bachelors of Science in physics (B.S), and the Bachelors of Science in Astrophysics jointly with the Astoronmy department (B.S). Depending on what kind of degree you are seeking will determine what courses you should think about taking. Of course you should consult your undergrad advisor for their advice on picking courses. 

Here is the link to the pdf the department has that more information about the physics program and an example of a typical course schedule for each degree. [Major Brochure 2018-2019](http://www.phys.virginia.edu/Education/Programs/MajorBrochure/default.pdf)

        This is often the first physics class someone will take when they begin the physics major at UVA. It is a calculus based introduction that covers the following topics: kinematics, mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and simple harmonic motion. This class is 5 credit course (4 credit lecture) and includes a 1 credit discussion session.

This class is an introduction into the C programming language and its purpose to familiarize students to solving basic physics problems using programming. In this class you will learn use of external libraries, implementation of basic algorithms with focus on numerical methods, and error analysis & data fitting. Lecture meets once a week and there is a lab session every week. 
<br>
<br>
A fair warning about this course, the material starts off really easy but it progressively gets more difficult, especially the final project. You can ask any who took this course and they will all tell you the same thing... START THE FINAL EARLY!

This is usally the first of the core classes that physics majors take and entials a more indepth and advanced investigation of classical physics. The course begins with a overview of topics covered in PHYS 1710(kinematics, momentum, and energy) but now with the knowledge of multivariable calculus, differtial equations, and linear algebra. Then students are introdued into lagrangian formalism and the calculus of variations, followed by orbits, rotinal motion of rigid bodies, and coupled spring problems.

The second half of quantum mechanics focuses less on the fomralism and more on the applications of quantum mechanics to modern problems. Depending on the instructor you might use a diffrent textbook and learn diffrent material, but you should certinly learn pertubation theory. 

There isnt a standard text but i would expect them to use griffiths, but it depends on who your instructor is. I personally don't care for the second half of griffiths.

Intermidate lab 1 and 2 are the same course just offered during different semesters. These courses are desgimned to teach studens on how to run more complicated and modern expierments that are bases on quanutm mechanics, solid state physics, and optics. Students will also learn on how to write exentesive and thorugh lab reports that require reading peer revieed literature. Students will be paired up in partersn and will choose 5 experinents to do that take about 2.5 weeks each. You will write a lab report for 4 of them and will then present the last one for a presentation grade. 
<br>
<br>
Like most labs, you can expect a lot of work outside of class.
