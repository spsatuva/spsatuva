Applying to graduate school can be confusing and overwhelming (and no one ever tells you how damn *expensive* it all is). SPS is here to help deobfuscate the messy application process.

**Disclaimer**: A lot of this advice is based on personal experience from a limited set of perspectives. If something in here doesn't resonate with you, that's absolutely fine and you should follow your own path. If you flat out disagree with what's written here, you can [bring up your issue here](https://github.com/spsatuva/spsatuva.github.io/issues) and we can change the content of this page to reflect what advice is most agreed upon.

# What does an application consist of?

Pretty much any application to a physics PhD program will consist of four things: a statement of purpose (frequently called the personal statement), a resume or curriculum vitae (CV), letters of recommendation, transcripts, standardized test scores, and for some applications a diversity statement (sometimes confusingly also called a personal statement). Unforuntunately there is no "Common App" for physics gradaute schools (although please make one), so each physics department has its own application and process, requiring you to submit essentially the same biograpihcal information and documents to each and every program. What follows is some advice on tackling each part of the application.

### Statement of Purpose / Personal Statement

The **Statement of Purpose** (SoP) is a 1 - 2 page essay written by you that outlines your intentions in applying to a certain graduate program. You usually **discuss your prior research experience** and the **specific research interests** you wish to pursue in graduate school. This is also a place for you to write about any parts of your application that you'd like to clarify for the admissions committee (e.g. a few bad grades in one semester, low physics GRE scores, etc.). Many dismiss the SoP as having little use, as people generally don't really know what they're going to study in graduate school, and people in STEM tend to not be the most eloquent writers (i.e. most SoPs are trash). However, the SoP really is **the ONLY portion of your application that you have complete control over**, and this is what makes it important. If you *are* a good writer (or you put enough time into your SoP), you have an opportunity to really impress admission committees with your ability to professionally present yourself. When reviewing applications, faculty are looking for future *colleagues*, which they would prefer would be mature and able to present themselves. A well-written SoP can get this exact message across, which is why it is an important part of your application.

The SoP needs to be contrasted and separated from the Personal Statement (or diversity statement). The **Personal Statement** is a 1 - 2 page essay that **clarifies your personal history** and provides you with a space to **discuss challenges that you've faced** in reaching the current stage of your career. The Personal Statement is really the only area of an application where you as a person enters into play. These statements exist because physics graduate admissions tends to favor those with an abundance of opportunities (i.e. rich kids at prestigious universities), and the statement allows admission committees to place your application in the context of your own life. If you've found yourself pretty advantaged throughout your life, you might be at a loss to talk about disadvantages you've faced. However, this doesn't mean you can't write anything. In these statements, admission committees are also looking for you to show **how you can improve the state of their own community**. For example, do you have a passion for teaching or outreach? You can discuss those passions in your statement and talk about how you focus on bringing opportunities to communities other than your own.

In general, both your SoP and Personal Statement will be **different** for **each school** you apply to. A SoP needs to provide **specific** detail about why you are applying to each program, and is thus inherently unique for each application. As discussed earlier, you generally want to emphasize how you can enhance a program's community in your Personal Statement, so each statement needs to be customized for each application as well. Further, schools may request specific information in your SoP or Personal Statement that other schools do not require, which further complicates the writing process. However, this does not mean you need to write a new statement from scratch for each program you apply to.

A SoP will generally have the following structure:
- Paragraph 1: Introduce who you are and talk about your interests. Not like your name, but talk about your **specific** work interests, what **your skills** are, and what **your interests** in physics are. Make it interesting and make yourself sound appealing. You can talk about the specific parts of physics that fascinate you *as they apply to* the program you are applying to (e.g. it's fine to talk about how dark matter fascinates if you want to work on cosmology projects in the program, but not if you're interested in condensed matter theory).
- Paragraph 2: Now is when you start name dropping. Name **at least 3** specific professors you would like to work with. Discuss why their work intrigues you and what you can bring to the table when working with them. This is where you can talk in specifics about the work you imagine yourself doing in graduate school. **At minimum, this is the only area you need to change** between the Statements of Purpose that you write for each applcation.
- Paragraph 3+: Talk about your research experience. Talk about the **specific contributions you have made** to the research you have been involved in. For each experience, mention **who** you worked with and **where** the work was performed. Each of these experiences you talk about will probably be written about in one of your letters of recommendations (some even underline the names of their letter writers as a cue that readers should cross reference what you wrote with your letters of recommendation), so you should write in a way to supplement what they may be writing about you.
- Conclusion: Wrap everything up. Discuss again, now that your reader knows more about your experience and intentions, why exactly you are applying to this program and what you want to do there. 

You don't have to follow this structure, but this outline provides a nice starting point for writting a **succinct** essay that gets the point across that you have skills the professors want and you have specific ideas about what you want to do. If you find it difficult to write in this manner, try a different essay structure that feels more natural to you. No matter what you end up writing and no matter what structure your essay has, just make sure you follow these two rules:
1. **DO NOT WASTE MY TIME**
   
   This should be the golden rule of all writing. Write with purpose and clarity so that the admission committee gets a clear understanding of your intentions in applying. This will also show them that you are smart and mature, which are good attributes to have in a grad student. Also keep in mind that admissions committees have to read *hundreds* of applications. If you're wasting their time with your writing, it's more reason to just glance over what you write which might weaken your application.

   Every sentence and paragraph should serve some purpose in constructing an ideal image of you as a grad student in the reader's mind. Try to actively think about what the image the reader constructs of you is as you write your SoP.

2. **DO NOT WRITE ABOUT YOUR EARLY CHILDHOOD**
   
   This is a big faux pas, and some still make the mistake of starting their application with their memories of falling in love with physics as a kid. Some applications will go so far as to explicitly request that you do not talk about this. If you start talking about how you've loved science ever since you used a chemistry set when you were 9, you're already breaking rule number 1.

### Resume / CV

Resumes and curriculum vitaes (CVs) are pretty standard. To get an idea of the expectation for how your resume should be formatted, take a look at the CVs of the professors you want to work with at the various schools you are applying to. In generally, they should list the following information:
- Biographical and contact information

  Your name, address, phone number, email, etc.

- Your educational history

  The universities you have attended and your dates of attendence (no high schools), your majors, and your GPA

- Your research/work experience

  List each of the research projects you have worked on and what your contribution was. If you don't have enough research experience, supplement with relevant work experience.

- A list of your publications/posters/talks

  If you have publications (most don't, but if you do - great!), you should list them with a full reference. Also list any posters and talks you've given on your work.

- (Optional) Scholarships and awards

  List all of the scholarships and awards you have received in college. Don't be shy, make it seem like a bigger deal than it is.

- (Optional) Teaching experience

  This can be listed under work experience as well, but it's good to include any TAing experience you have, as TAing is a core part of many graduate careers. If you have enough experience, this can be an entire portion of your resume.

- (Optional) Leadership and involvement

  If you have relevant leadership experience (on an exec board of a club) or outreach experience, it's good to list these on your resume

- (Optional) Technical skills

  You can also advertise special skills on your resume. If you program a lot, you can mention the useful languages you know. If you have a lot of experience in the lab, you can write down your lab skills and what special software you are adept with.

Your resume should be either exactly 1 or 2 pages. Don't make it 1.5 pages or something like that. There is generally a 2 page limit that prevents it from being too long. To make formatting easier, you should use LaTeX to write up your CV. Word is fine, but using LaTeX produces a more professional looking document. You can use a [template](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume) to make it easier. [This one](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/professional-cv) is pretty good.

### Letters of Recommendation

Generally, you'll need **three** letters of recommendation for your applications. For some applications, they will accept more than three letters, but three is all that is necessary. Well in advance of your application deadlines, you should begin reaching out to people who you'd like to write your letters of recommendation. Generally, professors are happy to write a few good words about their students. However, some might just not have much to say, or they might be too busy, so provide room for (and prepare for) refusal when you ask.

In each of your letters, admission committees are looking for good qualities, such as tenacity, intelligence, work ethic, and resolve, that their colleagues have identified in you. In general, you want to receive **good** letters of recommendation, so **you should seek out people who will write great things about you** in each of these areas. Primarily, you should be asking for letters from people you have worked under, either professors or post-docs, in a research experience or a work experience of some sort. These should be people that **you've worked with closely** and have a solid understanding of and high regard for the impact you've had on their research. If you don't have three people who you've worked with, your next best bet is a professor who has taught you in a course. In this case, you should seek out a professor who knows you well and who has high regard for you. You may have visited them many times in office hours and impressed them with your work ethic. It's not necessary that you were the best student in their class, but it is necessary that you impressed them and that they have something unique to say about you and your qualities as a person.

Your letter writers may ask that you send them your CV, so make sure you have one prepared for them. Along with your CV, send them a draft Statement of Purpose so they can understand your motivations for applying to your chosen schools and tailor their writing towards your goals. If you don't have a draft SoP, then at least in your request to them let them know explicitly what you hope they can write about you (e.g. you might say "I was hoping you could highlight X, Y, and Z about our work/time together" when you talk to them). Providing some guidance on what should be in the letter is a much appreciated step when requesting a letter. Finally, **send each of your letter writers a well formatted spreadsheet that contains information about all of the schools you're applying to** and a link to where they should submit their letter. Make it as easy as possible for them to not mess up when submitting your letter!

### Transcripts

You will either need to send an official or unofficial transcript in with each of your applications. You can get an unofficial transcript easily through SIS, and you can get an official UVA transcript [ordered through UVA](http://www.virginia.edu/registrar/transcript.html).

### Standardized Test Scores

In general, programs will require that you send BOTH your scores for the general GRE and the physics GRE to them through ETS's official score sending website. You will want to do this in advance of the submission deadline for each application, so that you can ensure your application is complete by the deadline. Some programs may not ask for you general GRE exam scores or your physics GRE exam scores.

### General Advice

It's a good idea to keep a spreadsheet with all of the schools you want to apply to along with information about which information you've sent them (transcript, letters, etc.), and which standardized test scores they require.

# How do I pick a program to apply to?

This is probably the hardest part to give specific advice on as which programs you should apply to depends on a lot of different factors, and is inherently a personal choice. In general though, **you should go to the school where you will have the most opportunities to do what you want to do**. "Most opportunities" can mean a lot. It can mean the school has a lot of funding and allows you to explore research freely. It can also mean that there is simply the largest number of faculty who's research intrigues you. It can also mean that that school has a nice science facility (e.g. an accelerator) where you can do your research. "What you want to do" is also vague, and is up to each person. Perhaps you are hyper-focused on research, and you want to go to a school where everyone else is like that. Perhaps you find the people you are with is more important to your happiness than the work you are doing, in which case you would want to ensure the faculty and students in your chosen department are friendly and have similar personalities to you. Perhaps you are more interested in the city you will be living in or the hiking opportunities available to you in the surrounding area of the school. These are all valid perspectives to have on what **you want** out of your graduate program, and they will all enter into your choice of schools that you apply to.

To get an idea of where different schools lie in how "good" they are, you can take a look at rankings, like the [US News rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/physics-rankings) or [other rankings which use other objective factors](https://www.chronicle.com/article/NRC-Rankings-Overview-/124705). [GradSchoolShopper](https://www.gradschoolshopper.com/gradschool/) is also an excellent place to find schools to apply to, and also provides information about acceptance rates at various schools. Pick a few school off these lists (don't automatically rule out MIT!), and **look at their websites** for more information. Go through their faculty pages and read up on their research. Write down in a notepad or document all the people who have research that stands out to you (**look for buzz words that you think sound cool**, as that tends to be a good indicator of you're own interests when you're unsure of what you want to do). You can use this as a starting point to narrow down which schools actually have science that sounds interesting to you. 

Finally, just ask around! Ask your friends who have graduated which programs they applied to and why. Ask the grad students in the physics and astronomy departments about their experience with graduate admissions as well, as they will be able to have a much more specific and tailored conversation about your thoughts in applying to graduate school than this website can provide.

### Personal experiences

Below you can find some advice from previous SPS members who have been through this process and wanted to share some words of wisdom to make your life easier.

> Understand your profile as an applicant. But you should shoot for the stars too because you’re worth it!

> Every professor in the department has gone through this process. Ask them about the program they went to.  If you’re interested in potentially going to an international program, talk to Baessler.

> Be sure that the research falls in line with your interests. However, your individual happiness is more important than anything, so be sure it’s somewhere you can flourish. When you visit, be sure to talk to the older graduate students about how they’re doing. Also try to get a sense of the community in the program. Grad school can take a toll on your physical and mental health, so it’s important that your superiors and colleagues are invested in you as a person.

> As much as we don’t want to make money an issue, if the program doesn’t offer very much of it you should maybe consider another. Also look into the cost of living in the area.

> Try to select a school that will make you happy in terms of every aspect, cause you don’t want to end up in a crappy situation for your life (which surprisingly exists beyond physics).

# How much will this all cost?

A lot. In total, one can expect to spend $1413 - $1921 on graduate school applications. One SPS student tallied up their own costs when applying to 12 schools, using fee waivers for applications, and spent a total of $1,141. So, **make sure you have $1,000 - $2,000 saved up** before applying to graduate schools!

### Applications 

Each application will cost you between $50 and $150 each to even submit them. **Fee waivers** can generally be obtained for applications if you qualify, and you should try to take advantage of those if money is an issue. Students usually apply to somewhere between 8 and 12 schools, which makes application costs ~$800 - $1200. 

### Standardized Tests

Taking the general GRE costs [$205 each time](https://www.ets.org/gre/fees) you take it and taking the physics GRE costs [$150 for each test](https://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about/fees/). Considering many take the general GRE once and the physics GRE twice, you're looking at a cost of $505 to just take the tests. Again, there **are fee waivers** for the GRE, however you can only claim one fee waiver for one test. The process for obtaining a fee waiver is needlessly complex and time consuming (including **mailing a form**!), so **plan ahead** and [apply for a fee waiver](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about/fees/reductions) well in advance of registering for one of the GRE exams.

Actually sending your scores to your schools is the last part of the financial burden. ETS charges $27 for each score report you send to a school (includes both general GRE and physics GRE). When actually taking a test, you will be able to send your scores to **four schools for free**. Take advantage of this to save $108! Again, using a figure of 8 - 12 schools, you are looking at a cost of $108 - $216 to send your scores.
